        <h2>About (God)</h2>
        <img src="img/god.png" alt="god" class="wrap-image">
        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Yahweh">YHVH</a>, also referred to as God, is the one deity of Abrahamic faiths, common to Judaism, Christianity, Islam and many other religious denominations. Some consider the Zoroastrian god <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Ahura_Mazda" title="Ahura Mazda">Ahura Mazda</a> and the Egyptian god Aten to be the same figure or to have served as an inspiration for it.
        </p><p>He is often conceived as a genderless, omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent deity, an uncreated creator who created the universe out of nothingness, who is also responsible for the creation of <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Angel" title="Angel">angels</a>, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Human" title="Human">humans</a> and all living and spiritual beings, among them creatures such as the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Jinn" title="Jinn">jinn</a>.
        </p><p>His deeds change throughout the many religions that worship him, however, the three main monotheist religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) tend to portray similar events, such as <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Adam" title="Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Eve" title="Eve">Eve</a>'s banishment from <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Eden" title="Eden">Eden</a> and the covenant made by God with Abraham and the people of Israel, they differ, however, in their view on important figures such as Jesus Christ and the prophet Muhammad.
        </p><p>Christians conceive God as an entity of pure good. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Trinity">Trinitarian</a> traditions, He is composed of three different identities that are, at the same time, one and the same: God the father, God the son and the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Holy_Ghost" title="Holy Ghost">holy spirit</a>. This is known as the Holy Trinity, with Jesus Christ the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Messiah_(Persona)" title="Messiah (Persona)">messiah</a> being the son. Christians await the return of Jesus Christ and Judgement Day, when the devil will be defeated and the Millennium Kingdom of God will come to Earth. Other figures are <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Maria" title="Maria">Maria</a>, "Mother of God," the woman who chose to bear Jesus and ascended to Heaven, and the four archangels <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Michael" title="Michael">Michael</a>, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Gabriel" title="Gabriel">Gabriel</a>, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Raphael" title="Raphael">Raphael</a> and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Uriel" title="Uriel">Uriel</a>, and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Lucifer" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> as a fallen angel rebelling against God with his army of demons. Judaism and Islam differ in that they conceive God as a singular identity, rejecting the concept of the Trinity, but they agree about the existence of demons and an angelic hierarchy.
        </p><p>Some interpretations, especially the one from Gnostic Christianity, differ in many ways from the view of God the father as a benevolent entity; instead, they portray him as a <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Demiurge" title="Demiurge">Demiurge</a>, a false god who wants to control humanity, an enemy to the true God. The gnostic interpretation of God is heavily influenced by Greek philosophy and a partial reading of the Old Testament, and was thus rejected by the ascending Christian Church.
        </p><p>YHVH is the most common transliteration of the Hebrew name of God. The name itself is a reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tetragrammaton">Tetragrammaton</a>, which represents the four letters of the name of God: Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh (or simply "YHVH"). Each of the letters corresponds to a world and a soul and stands for the four basic stages of the process of creation. The name is derived from the Hebrew word "יהיה" ("to be"), modified into a variant form with a masculine prefix. Its meaning and implications have been a source of contemplation and debate for thousands of years, which still continues today. By Hebrew tradition, it is not to be pronounced aloud, and is typically substituted with "Adonai" ("my Lord") in prayers. In speech, Hashem ("the name") is used in its place.

        <br>
        <p>In <i>Megami Tensei</i> series, the Abrahamic God is the symbol of Law <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Alignment" title="Alignment">alignment</a>. Throughout the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Megami_Tensei_Multiverse" title="Megami Tensei Multiverse">Megami Tensei Multiverse</a>, YHVH is an agent of the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Great_Will" title="Great Will">Great Will</a> who carries out its intentions within a particular cosmos, usually as a vain dictator which ensures everything in it will remain under his control. However, this isn't universal and incarnations of YHVH may have different origins and histories. For example, in <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei" title="Shin Megami Tensei"><i>Shin Megami Tensei</i></a>, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Echidna" title="Echidna">Echidna</a> states he was originally one god among many. Meanwhile, in <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_III:_Nocturne" title="Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne"><i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</i></a>, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Kagutsuchi" title="Kagutsuchi">Kagutsuchi</a> (who is stated by the game's artbook to be a name for YHVH), is stated to exist outside of the universe, and sustains the creation of universes itself.
        </p><p>In most continuities, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Lucifer" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> always rejected YHVH's authority and took one-third of the heavenly host to revolt against him, before being defeated and banished to the demon world, falling from grace and subsequently becoming the lord of <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Demon" title="Demon">demons</a>. In continuities where YHVH was stated to be once no different from other gods, YHVH is also responsible for demonizing other gods by using his teachings to influence humanity. YHVH is thus commonly referred to as the "true enemy" by Lucifer and demons who align with Chaos.
        </p><p>Generally speaking, YHVH allows humans to have technical free will, but detests meaningful rebellion against his authority and will openly condemn those who choose to pursue that path. He desires worship of only himself and threatens punishment upon any who defy his will. YHVH claims to feel the emotions of all human beings and their suffering, but this does not deter him from taking extreme and inhumane courses of action. His offers of mercy are likewise only extended to those who are willing and able to recommit to obedience to his will and not to those who remain in opposition to him.

        <p>YHVH appears as a respected figure in <i>Shin Megami Tensei II</i>, he is worshiped by the people of <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Tokyo_Millennium" title="Tokyo Millennium">Tokyo Millennium</a>. They are foretold that a savior will descend from God, and show the citizens salvation. Since the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Order_of_Messiah" title="Order of Messiah">Messians</a> running Tokyo Millennium are angels, and because the aforementioned 'savior' has yet to arrive, they begin fearing that YHVH has abandoned them. They believed that, if they carried out the plans as YHVH foretold, YHVH would once again appear before them. In order to do so, they need a savior they could control. That savior is <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Aleph" title="Aleph">Aleph</a>.
        </p><p>In ancient times, YHVH created <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Lucifer" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a> respectively. Satan was used as an instrument to judge the world, humans, angels and demons alike. However, Lucifer's pride allowed him to revolt against God and was banished from heaven.
        </p><p>In the Neutral and Chaos alignment paths, Satan is ordered by YHVH to use the Megiddo Ark (a powerful laser weapon within <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Eden" title="Eden">Eden</a>) to destroy all life on the planet as his judgment. He is killed by Aleph before he can carry out his plans, and his death prompts the appearance of YHVH in Eden. In the Law alignment, Satan will turn on YHVH to punish him for committing the sin of genocide; however, he crumbles to dust after defeating his creator. Should Aleph choose to align with Lucifer, he would join Aleph in defeating YHVH in his angel form, and he would disappear after his creator.
        </p><p>In all routes, the party will be transported to Eden in order to defeat YHVH. In the Neutral and Chaos routes, they must face his three avatars <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Sabaoth" title="Sabaoth">Sabaoth</a>, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Shaddai" title="Shaddai">Shaddai</a>, and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Elohim" title="Elohim">Elohim</a>, as well as Satan before finally meeting YHVH. In the Law route however, all of the three avatar bosses will be skipped, and Satan will not be fought due to him being in the party already.
        </p><p>In the Chaos and Neutral alignments, prior to Aleph's battle with YHVH, he is forewarned that by defying God's will, Aleph will suffer a never-ending cycle of punishment, as YHVH would torture Aleph, kill him, reincarnate him and continue torturing him until the end of time for committing the 'Ultimate Sin': Deicide. However, interestingly enough, in the Law alignment, YHVH never mentions sending Aleph to Hell, instead only mentioning punishing Satan.
        </p><p>After being defeated on the Neutral route, YHVH states that humanity is weak and needs someone to rely on, feeling that humans can't live on their own, and states that as long as people wish for his salvation, the Great Will of the universe will recreate him. On the Chaos route, YHVH will state that he can't stand seeing a confused world, not under his control, question who will rule the confused world, and asks if Aleph and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Hiroko" title="Hiroko">Hiroko's</a> names will be worshiped as saviors, before stating that he'll be recreated. On the Law route, YHVH will state that they have rejected his salvation by being judged and punished by his creations, questioning if humans can find their own paths without him guiding them, before stating that the Great Will of the universe will recreate him.

        <p>YHVH has an important role in the backstory, but his actual presence is only seen in a <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/New_Game_Plus" title="New Game Plus">New Game+</a>. In the distant past, YHVH or God trampled the mother goddesses and subjugated humanity on Earth. Before the main events of the story, worship of God falters and causes him to weaken his seal on the mother goddesses. In that moment of weakness, God was attacked and shattered by the mother goddesses of the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Schwarzwelt" title="Schwarzwelt">Schwarzwelt</a>. The goddesses attempt to restore the original state of the world and eliminate human civilization through the Schwarzwelt due to humanity having wasted the world away. Several of YHVH's fragments were sealed in the Schwarzwelt itself.
        </p><p>YHVH first appears as a human in a <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Demonica" title="Demonica">Demonica</a>, and later, after being partially restored, as <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Metatron" title="Metatron">Metatron</a> and requests the help of the protagonist to defeat <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Alilat" title="Alilat">Alilat</a> and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Demiurge" title="Demiurge">Demiurge</a>. After the protagonist defeats the Demiurge, YHVH attempts to absorb Demiurge's power and restore himself, but the protagonist can shut him off and seal him by canceling the fusion midway through. A voice warns the protagonist not to release the "Arrogant God" - referring to YHVH. If the fusion is successful, YHVH takes the Demiurge's appearance, becomes known as "Refined Voice" and says that he's slowly returning to his true form "full of light." The Refined Voice says that the true enemy is the spirit of the Earth itself, and promises to help and protect humanity as long as humanity is obedient to the holy spirit. If the protagonist chooses to follow the celestial feminine voice, Metatron will be sealed away and the protagonist will gain the same reward from the mission.
        </p><p>In <i>Redux</i>, it is stated that <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Shekinah" title="Shekinah">Shekinah</a>, the form <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/The_Three_Wise_Men" title="The Three Wise Men">The Three Wise Men</a> take in, is another fragment of God, with the men stating that <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Mem_Aleph" title="Mem Aleph">Mem Aleph</a> stole their power and divided it into pieces.

        </p><p>In the Law ending, YHVH's benevolence is highlighted; in the time following the genocide of Tokyo, YHVH is said to bask in the happiness of a humanity that has finally purged itself of sin and ended the cycle of suffering. On the one hand, it is therefore possible that YHVH's tyranny in this universe is the result of well-intentioned extremism to end suffering and create a perfect world, which may explain why the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Great_Reason" title="Great Reason">Great Reason</a> simultaneously supports and opposes him. On the other hand, YHVH may have gone insane from the impossible task of reconciling humanity's conflicting ideas of how to create a utopia for itself due to the existence of free will, which the intervention of messiahs subsequently resolves by committing humanity down a particular course.

        </div>
        <p>YHVH, also known as the Creator God, is revealed to have become extremely tyrannical and unfit for rule during the events of both games. He controlled both halves of <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a> (<a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Lucifer" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Merkabah" title="Merkabah">Merkabah</a>) and the forces of Chaos and Law to perpetuate an eternal war that will never have a true winner to make sure that he will forever be in power. YHVH becomes reviled by gods and humans alike, to the point that pagan gods gather and form <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Divine_Powers" title="Divine Powers">Divine Powers</a> in an attempt to rebel against him and create a new universe without him.
        </p><p>His madness had made him an enemy of the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Great_Reason" title="Great Reason">Great Reason</a>, who had been creating and incarnating messiahs to oppose him, with two messiahs, Flynn and Nanashi, needed to bring humans true freedom from YHVH's grasp in this universe. He acts as the game's true final boss on both of its true ending routes, as the game's Law and Chaos routes are bad endings.
        </p><p>In the final battle, it's made clear humans are capable of denying YHVH's current existence just by words alone, and upon losing his throne, he becomes a primitive demon consisting of multiple animals fused together, displaying how far his moral authority has fallen in the eyes of humanity.
        </p><p>On the Bonds Route, YHVH is defeated by the two godslayers (<a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Nanashi" class="mw-disambig" title="Nanashi">Nanashi</a> and Flynn) and their friends, but not before implying he will return one day. Mankind, the two messiahs and demons will live together until the day that they must all oppose him again comes. On the Massacre Route, he is slain by the godslayers and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Dagda" title="Dagda">Dagda</a>'s powers and, with no followers and the creation of a new universe removing everything of the old universe, YHVH is permanently killed, freeing humanity from his tyranny forever.

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Battle_Analysis">Battle Analysis</span><template></template></h4>
        <p>YHVH's battle is perhaps the most difficult non-DLC battle of the game. He resists everything, meaning that Nanashi's own Awakened Power or any Pierce passives are needed to do decent damage. However, the battle has a unique perk to it - that the player alternates between their party and Flynn's party. On Bonds, Satan will split into <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Jonathan" title="Jonathan">Jonathan</a> and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Walter" title="Walter">Walter</a>, who will join Flynn and <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Isabeau" title="Isabeau">Isabeau</a> for the battle. This also means Isabeau will not be available as a battle partner. On Massacre, Flynn's party will consist solely of himself and Satan, making the battle a bit harder especially if one locked themselves into a battle partner who isn't as good for boss fights.
        </p><p>Flynn's signature move is his Godslayer's Sword skill. This almighty attack, when used on YHVH, will count as hitting a weakness, consuming half a Press Turn even if it hits YHVH while he is Smirking. Godslayer's Sword will always reduce YHVH's resistance to a random element, and with luck, it can create elemental weaknesses which will speed up the flow of the battle.
        </p><p>The first part of the battle is a fair bit simpler: YHVH has rather standard abilities like Luster Candy and Debilitate. His elemental spells can pierce resistances, but his physical attacks are considerably weaker. Keep an eye out for Divine Harmony, which can erase all effects, including Charge, Smirk and Doping, from your party. Fielding a demon who is immune to physical attacks can easily rob him of Press Turns.
        </p><p>As the fight progresses, you have prompts to attempt to deny his divinity, weakening him in the process. On Bonds, your allies can do it for you; on Massacre, you are presented with dialogue options which can fail at undermining his divinity. As his health falls he may begin to use Authoritative Stance that can remove 3 of your Press Turns, which can effectively skip an understaffed party's entire turn.
        </p><p>Once the second phase starts, YHVH will spend his first few turns demonstrating his most fearsome skills. Infinite Power which completely maxes out his stat buffs and gives him Smirk status, making the next attack be potentially lethal if not dealt with quickly. Bring Dekaja or Magaon to break this effect. Unending Curse instead completely debuffs the active party, leaving them vulnerable to his next onslaught. He also attacks mainly with physical attacks in the form of Crush and Rampage, which can be easily stopped if met with anything immune to Phys. His strongest attack, Supernova, is used shortly after the second use of Infinite Power, and can easily do massive damage and completely destroy a party even without any buffs or debuffs in play. Doping becomes nearly essential to this fight, as it can mean the difference between survival or death, and turns wasted reviving dead party members are also turns not spent keeping the momentum against his attacks. While buffs and debuffs are important, take care not to spend too many turns setting them up as he can easily erase them (along with Doping, Charge, Concentrate, etc.) with Divine Harmony.
        </p><p>Flynn and his party are easily the greatest asset in this fight, but fortunately, his party will always have the essential support skills for the fight. Any human characters in that party will have access to an independent stock of recovery items to keep themselves in shape. Continuously use Godslayer's Sword until YHVH has a weakness that your party can exploit before making the most of your free Press Turns.

        <p>YVHV is never named in <i>Shin Megami Tensei V</i> and is only ever called by the moniker "the God of Law." Eons ago, the God of Law ascended to the Throne of Creation, overthrowing <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Baal" title="Baal">Baal</a> to rule over the universe as well as taking the four archangels from Baal's command. Under the God of Law's rule, all other <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Nahobino_(race)" title="Nahobino (race)">Nahobino</a> were stripped of their knowledge, degrading them into demons. He would go on to store that knowledge inside the garden of Eden in the form of the Fruit of Knowledge. When the fruit was eaten by Adam and Eve, that knowledge was passed on to their descendants.
        </p><p>18 Years before the beginning of the story, a war called Armageddon initiates a <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Conception" title="Conception">Conception</a> event, destroying <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. During the battle Lucifer slays the God of Law and dethrones him. With the last of his strength the God of Law enacted a miracle, creating a false Tokyo for the humans to live in. Lucifer then took the God of Law's Knowledge, but rejected the throne, instead waiting for another Nahobino to rise and lead all of creation out of the endless cycle of death and rebirth.

        <p>While not actually appearing, it is heavily implied that "Yehowah" is responsible for the Tokyo lockdown, as <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Metatron" title="Metatron">Metatron</a> was commanded to start it. Just before the fight with <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Belial" title="Belial">Belial</a>, <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Loki" title="Loki">Loki</a> explains the history of the <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/King_of_Bel" title="King of Bel">King of Bel</a>, saying that in 2,500 BC, Bel ruled the world, until Yehowah defeated him in 600 BC. Yehowah is presented more amiably in this than in other <i>Megami Tensei</i> titles, as the angel <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Remiel" title="Remiel">Remiel</a> is sent to aid the player and genuinely desires to help the player save humanity. In one of the game's endings, the player can side with Yehowah and become the new Messiah, bringing the world towards peace. Another route allows the player to become the King of Bel and challenge Yehowah for rulership of creation.
        </p><p>In <i>Overclocked</i>, both of these routes are extended into 8th Days. Yehowah can also choose to abandon humanity if the player takes <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Yuzu_Tanikawa" title="Yuzu Tanikawa">Yuzu's</a> route and plays through her 8th Day scenario, where humanity fails its ordeal and then rejects Yehowah, causing the deity to abandon mankind in return. <i>Overclocked</i> also puts a darker light on the motives of Yehowah in the game. As the general conclusion that comes from <a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Amane_Kuzuryu" title="Amane Kuzuryu">Amane's</a> 8th Day by the characters is that he intentionally set up the Cain and Abel scenario for two reasons: To have a first murderer (<a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Naoya_(Devil_Survivor)" title="Naoya (Devil Survivor)">Cain</a>) and a first martyr (<a href="/megamitensei/wiki/Protagonist_(Devil_Survivor)" title="Protagonist (Devil Survivor)">Abel</a>).
